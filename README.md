# COMPOSE CAMP

Attendance Recording App

<b> Problem Statement: </b>
Why mark attendance attendance still offline when we are in digital era!
This project proposes an "Attendance Recording App" to record the attendance of the students in a particular class.
This app gives an ease to the faculty to mark the attendance of the entire class at his/her fingertips.


<b> Proposed Solution </b>
The faculty need to login to the app using the username and password provided.
A list of classes will appear on the screen from where the faculty has to choose the appropriate class.
The faculty gets the list of the students where he/she need to mark the attendance of the students by using a button beside the name of the student.
Once the attendance is taken of the entire class the faculty will get a scrollable lsut of the students present and absent in that particukar lecture.

<b> Technology Stack USed </b>
Android Studio
Kotlin

# Functionality & Concepts Used :

-To keep track of the attendance
-Teachers can login and mark attendance of the students


## Concepts used in the app:

- **JetPack Navigation:**
  Navigation refers to the interactions that allow users to navigate across, into, and back out from the different pieces of content within your app. Android Jetpack's Navigation component helps you implement navigation, from simple button clicks to more complex patterns, such as app bars and the navigation drawer.
- **Jetpack Compose:**
  Jetpack Compose is Android's modern toolkit for building native UI. It simplifies and accelerates UI development on Android. Quickly bring your app to life with less code, powerful tools, and intuitive Kotlin APIs.
- **Material Design:**
  Material is an adaptable system of guidelines, components, and tools that support the best practices of user interface design. Backed by open-source code.
- **Lazy List:**
  As the name suggests, the difference between LazyColumn and LazyRow is the orientation in which they lay out their items and scroll.
- **Composable Functions**
  Composable functions (also referred to as composables or components) are special Kotlin functions that are used to create user interfaces when working with Compose. A composable function is differentiated from regular Kotlin functions in code using the @Composable annotation.

  
<b> Future Scope </b>
The app is in the alpha stage and is being currently tested, discussed and developed by the student developers here at GDSC PCE.
The future scope of the app is to make it world wide by publishing it on the playstore and also add more features for the faculty.
In the future scope of the app AI could be used to take automatic attendance of the students.
